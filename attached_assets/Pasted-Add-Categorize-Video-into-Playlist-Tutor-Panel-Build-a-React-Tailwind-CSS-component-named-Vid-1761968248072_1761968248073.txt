Add & Categorize Video into Playlist (Tutor Panel)

Build a React + Tailwind CSS component named VideoPlaylistManager.jsx.

🎯 Purpose:

Allow tutors to upload (or link) new videos and assign them to playlists (categories), view existing playlists, and manage videos within them.

✅ Functional Requirements:

Add Video Form:

Fields:

Video Title (text)

Description (textarea)

Video URL (from Drive) (text input)

Select Playlist (dropdown)

New Playlist Name (text input – appears if tutor wants to create a new playlist)

Submit Button → “Add Video”

When submitting:

If a new playlist name is entered, create a new playlist before adding the video.

Convert Google Drive share link → embed link:

Input: https://drive.google.com/file/d/FILE_ID/view?usp=sharing  
Output: https://drive.google.com/uc?export=preview&id=FILE_ID  


Send a POST request using Axios to /api/videos with JSON payload:

{
  "title": "Video Title",
  "description": "Description",
  "video_url": "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=preview&id=FILE_ID",
  "playlist_id": "selected_playlist_id"
}


If creating a new playlist, send POST to /api/playlists first, then use the returned playlist_id.

Show success/error alerts using a simple state message.

Playlist & Video Display Section:

Fetch playlists from /api/playlists (GET).

Display playlists in collapsible cards (accordion style).

Inside each playlist card, list all videos assigned to that playlist:

Show Title, Description, and Video Preview (iframe).

Include Delete Video button → calls DELETE /api/videos/:id.

Include Edit button (optional placeholder).

Use Tailwind grid/flex layout for responsive video cards.

UX / UI Requirements:

Clean, card-based layout using Tailwind (shadow-lg, rounded-2xl, p-6, space-y-4).

Use Tailwind colors: neutral background, soft hover effects.

Place “Add Video” form at the top and playlists section below.

Responsive on mobile — stack layout vertically.

Technical Notes:

Use Axios for all API calls.

Manage state with React’s useState and useEffect.

Handle loading and error states gracefully.

Export component as default:

export default VideoPlaylistManager;


(Optional Enhancements):

Add “Add Playlist” modal.

Allow drag-and-drop to reorder videos within a playlist.

Add search/filter bar to find videos or playlists quickly.
