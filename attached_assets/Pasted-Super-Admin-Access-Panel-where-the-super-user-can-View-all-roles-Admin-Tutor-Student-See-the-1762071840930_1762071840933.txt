Super Admin Access Panel, where the super user can:

View all roles (Admin, Tutor, Student)

See their available features (like Dashboard, Playlists, Payments, etc.)

Assign or remove access by ticking checkboxes

Store those access rights in state (mock backend can be added later)

🧠 Here’s the enhanced Replit AI prompt (single-file, App.jsx version)

Build a React + Tailwind CSS single-file app (App.jsx) for a Learning Management System (LMS) frontend with Super Admin access control and role-based dashboards (Admin, Tutor, Student).

🚀 Core Requirements:

Use React Router DOM for navigation.

Use React Context API to manage authentication and role-based access.

Include four roles:

Super Admin — can assign permissions

Admin

Tutor

Student

Each role should have a different sidebar and dashboard view.

Use Tailwind CSS for styling.

Everything in a single App.jsx file (no imports outside except React, Router, Tailwind).

🧩 Pages/Components (all inside App.jsx):

AuthContext – manages login/logout & role.

LoginPage – name, email, and dropdown for role (Super Admin, Admin, Tutor, Student).

Sidebar – dynamic links based on role & permissions.

TopBar – shows title, search, and logout.

Dashboard – shows metric cards (mock data).

SuperAdminPanel – main feature.

ProtectedRoute – blocks unauthorized access.

🧠 Super Admin Panel (key behavior):

Route: /superadmin

Shows three collapsible cards for Admin, Tutor, and Student.

Each card lists features available to that role (e.g. Dashboard, Users, Playlist, Payments, Reports, Settings).

Each feature has a checkbox → can select/deselect.

Selected features update a permissions state object, example:

{
  admin: ["Dashboard", "Users", "Reports"],
  tutor: ["Dashboard", "Upload Videos"],
  student: ["Dashboard", "Explore"]
}


Store this object in React state (mock backend comment placeholder).

Add a “Save Changes” button (console.log permissions on save).

Use Tailwind for neat UI (cards, checkboxes, save button).

Add success toast or alert for “Changes Saved”.

💡 Dashboard Access:

Only features selected in Super Admin panel should appear in that role’s sidebar and dashboard.

Example: If Admin has only “Dashboard” and “Users”, then only those sidebar links appear.

🎨 Styling:

Tailwind only.

Blue-gray & indigo theme.

Rounded corners, shadows, hover transitions.

Collapsible sidebar on mobile.

⚙️ Output Expectation:

A fully working single-file App.jsx that runs in Replit with:

Login screen with 4 roles

Super Admin panel with checkbox access control

Role-based sidebar that reflects access rights

Dashboard with mock cards

Logout functionality

Include inline comments where backend APIs can later be connected.

Code should be about 300–350 lines, cleanly structured with comments.
