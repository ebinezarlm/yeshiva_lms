Unified Video Upload Form (YouTube / Vimeo / Google Drive / File Upload + Playlist)

Build a React + Tailwind CSS component called UnifiedVideoManager.jsx.

🎯 Purpose:

Create a single interface for tutors to add new videos to the LMS from multiple sources — YouTube, Vimeo, Google Drive, or direct upload — and organize them into playlists.

✅ Functional Requirements:
1. Form Sections:

Video Source Selector (Tabs or Radio Buttons):
Options:

YouTube / Vimeo Link

Google Drive Link

Upload File

Common Fields:

Video Title (text input)

Description (textarea)

Playlist Selection:

Dropdown to choose existing playlist (GET /api/playlists)

“+ New Playlist” input (conditionally shown)

2. Source-specific Inputs:

If YouTube / Vimeo selected → show input field for video URL.

If Google Drive selected → show input for Drive link and auto-convert it to embed format:

Input: https://drive.google.com/file/d/FILE_ID/view?usp=sharing  
Output: https://drive.google.com/uc?export=preview&id=FILE_ID


If Upload File selected → show file input (<input type="file" accept="video/*" />)
and preview the video before upload.

3. Preview Section:

After user provides a link or file, show a live preview:

For YouTube/Vimeo: <iframe> embed

For Drive: <iframe> with converted link

For upload: <video controls /> preview

4. Submit Logic:

On Submit, based on selected source:

If YouTube/Vimeo: send JSON payload via POST /api/videos

{
  "title": "Video Title",
  "description": "Description",
  "video_url": "https://youtube.com/... or https://vimeo.com/...",
  "playlist_id": "playlist_id",
  "source": "youtube/vimeo"
}


If Google Drive: send same payload, but with converted video_url and "source": "drive".

If Upload File:
Use FormData and POST to /api/videos/upload with fields:
title, description, playlist_id, and the file.

On success, display a success message (“Video added successfully!”), clear the form, and refresh the playlist list.

5. Playlist Handling:

Fetch playlists from /api/playlists on mount (GET).

If user enters a new playlist name, POST to /api/playlists first, then use the returned playlist_id for video upload.

🧰 Technical Implementation:

Use React Hooks (useState, useEffect) for managing form and state.

Use Axios for API calls.

Handle conditional rendering of fields based on selected source type.

Include upload progress bar for file uploads.

Handle errors gracefully (invalid URL, empty fields, etc.).

Export component as:

export default UnifiedVideoManager;

💅 UI / UX Guidelines:

Use Tailwind to create a clean, card-style layout:
bg-white shadow-lg rounded-2xl p-6 max-w-3xl mx-auto mt-10

Use tabs or segmented buttons for source selection.

Inputs: border border-gray-300 rounded-md p-2 w-full mb-4

Button: bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded-md

Responsive layout for mobile screens.

Show progress bar and success messages in visually clear sections.



Add drag-and-drop file upload area.

Allow multiple uploads to a single playlist.

Add video thumbnail extraction (if from YouTube/Vimeo).

Include a small “Playlist Summary” below form showing existing videos per playlist.
