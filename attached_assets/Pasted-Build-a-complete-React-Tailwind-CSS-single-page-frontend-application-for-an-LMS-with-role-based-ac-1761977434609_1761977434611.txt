Build a complete React + Tailwind CSS single-page frontend application for an LMS with role-based access (Admin, Tutor, Student). Use React Router for routing, React Context (or Redux Toolkit) for simple auth/role state, and modular components. Provide a polished, production-like UI with mock JSON data and clear API call placeholders (Axios). Do not add backend logic — only frontend, but include comments where backend calls will be made. Make it responsive and accessible. Export default the main App component.

🔧 Requirements & Behavior

Role-based routing / Auth Simulation

Provide a simple LoginPage with role select (Admin / Tutor / Student). On login, set a user object in Context: { id, name, email, role }.

After login, redirect to /dashboard. The app should render the appropriate dashboard based on user.role.

Protect routes: if not authenticated, redirect to /login.

Main layout

Shared layout: fixed Sidebar (collapsible), TopNavbar (search + notifications + profile dropdown), and a scrollable content region.

Sidebar items adapt to role (Admin: Dashboard, Users, Playlists, Payments, Invoices, Analytics, Settings; Tutor: Dashboard, My Playlists, Upload Videos, Comments, Earnings, Profile; Student: Dashboard, My Playlists, Explore, Subscriptions, Q&A, Profile).

App.jsx (routes and layout)

Core UX & Features to implement (frontend only)

Admin: users table (name, email, playlist(s), due date, amount paid, invoice download), filters, search, status badges, playlist modal, invoice download (dummy link), summary cards, analytics charts (use Recharts with mock data).

Tutor: create/edit playlists, upload videos (support link, Drive, and file upload), assign videos to playlists, list videos per playlist, delete/edit video, view & reply to student questions (reply modal), preview videos.

Student: browse playlists, subscribe (mock), view videos, like, comment, ask question, bookmark (watch later), continue watching, progress bars per playlist.

UnifiedVideoManager.jsx must include source selector (YouTube/Vimeo, Google Drive, Upload), preview, playlist assign/create flow, and submission with Axios placeholders:

POST /api/playlists (create playlist)

POST /api/videos (link-based)

POST /api/videos/upload (multipart/form-data for file)

Use Axios for API call placeholders and document where to replace with real endpoints.

Mock Data

Provide realistic mock arrays for users, playlists, videos, subscriptions, invoices, and analytics. Display those in each page by default.

Use ISO dates and currency formatting for amounts.

Styling & UI

Use Tailwind utility classes for layout, spacing, rounded corners, shadow, hover states.

Sidebar: supportive icons (HeroIcons or Lucide) and active state.

TopNavbar: small search input, notification bell, profile avatar.

Cards & Tables: responsive, with mobile-friendly stacking and horizontal scroll for tables.

Modals and toasts: use small Tailwind-based components for confirmations and success messages.

Accessibility & Responsiveness

All interactive elements keyboard-focusable and have aria- labels where needed.

Mobile-first responsive behavior: sidebar collapses to top hamburger on mobile.

State Management

Use React Context (AuthContext) for user state.

Use useState / useEffect local state for pages; include notes where global state or server state would be used.

Extras (Optional progressive enhancement)

Dark mode toggle saved to localStorage.

Upload progress indicator for file uploads using Axios onUploadProgress.

Recharts charts in AdminAnalytics (Line, Bar, Pie, Area) with mock data.

Project Output

Provide full React code (JSX + Tailwind classes) with clear component exports.

Include comments near every API call noting the expected server behavior and response shape.

The App.jsx should show routes: /login, /dashboard, /admin/*, /tutor/*, /student/*, with a fallback 404 page.
