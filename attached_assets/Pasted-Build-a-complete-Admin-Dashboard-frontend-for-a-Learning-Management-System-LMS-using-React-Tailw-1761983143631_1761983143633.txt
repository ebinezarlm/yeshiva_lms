Build a complete Admin Dashboard frontend for a Learning Management System (LMS) using React + Tailwind CSS.

The dashboard should have multiple sections accessible from a sidebar navigation:

1. Dashboard (Overview)


2. Users


3. Playlists


4. Payments


5. Settings




---

🧩 1. Dashboard (Overview Page)

Display key statistics using cards and charts (dummy data ok):

Total Users

Active Subscriptions

Total Revenue

Expiring Subscriptions


Include a simple line/bar chart to show revenue growth over time

Optional: Add a pie chart showing active vs expired subscriptions

Add a dark mode toggle in the top bar



---

👥 2. Users Page

Display a table of all registered users with columns:
| User Name | Email | Playlist(s) | Subscription Start | Due Date | Amount Paid | Status | Invoice |

Include search and filter dropdown (Active / Expired / All)

Each row should have:

“View Details” button → opens a modal showing full user profile and playlist history

“Download Invoice” button → triggers invoice download (placeholder link)


Add pagination for long lists

Use cards or hover effects for better UI readability



---

🎞️ 3. Playlists Page

Display all playlists created by tutors in card view
Each card shows:

Playlist Title

Category (e.g., Math, Science, Coding)

Number of videos

Tutor Name

Date Created


Include a button to Add New Playlist → opens a modal form with fields:

Playlist Title

Description

Category (dropdown)

Add Videos (from YouTube/Vimeo, Google Drive, or File Upload)


Include options to:

Edit Playlist details

Delete Playlist

View Playlist content (opens modal or separate page)


Use a grid layout with responsive Tailwind design



---

💳 4. Payments Page

Display a table with columns:
| User Name | Email | Playlist | Payment Date | Amount | Status (Success / Pending / Failed) | Invoice |

Include filters by status and date range

Show summary cards on top:

Total Earnings

Pending Payments

Failed Transactions


Optional: Small bar chart showing earnings per month



---

⚙️ 5. Settings Page

Simple layout with forms to configure:

Subscription Pricing (Monthly, Yearly)

Currency and Tax %

Admin Profile (Name, Email, Password)

Logout Button


Use Tailwind forms and validation UI



---

🎨 Styling & UI Requirements

Clean, professional Tailwind design

Sidebar with icons and labels (Dashboard, Users, Playlists, Payments, Settings)

Top navigation bar with search, notifications, and admin profile dropdown

Consistent spacing, rounded corners, shadowed cards

Mobile-responsive (stack layout on small screens)

Color palette: blue-gray, indigo, and white tones



---

⚡ Optional Enhancements

Implement dark mode toggle

Add loading skeletons for table and chart data

Animate transitions between sidebar pages using Framer Motion (optional)


The output should be a React + Tailwind project structure ready to integrate with a Python backend later.
