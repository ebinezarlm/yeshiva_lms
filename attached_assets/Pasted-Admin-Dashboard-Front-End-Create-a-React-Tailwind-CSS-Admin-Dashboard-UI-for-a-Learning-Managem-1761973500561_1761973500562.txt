Admin Dashboard (Front-End)

Create a React + Tailwind CSS Admin Dashboard UI for a Learning Management System (LMS).

🧩 Requirements / Features

Dashboard Overview Page

A responsive layout with a sidebar and a top navbar.

Sidebar sections:

Dashboard (overview)

Users

Subscriptions

Invoices

Settings

Top navbar should include:

App title: “Admin Dashboard”

Search bar

Profile dropdown (Admin name + Logout option)

Dashboard Widgets (Top Section)

Display four summary cards using Tailwind grid layout:

Total Users

Active Subscriptions

Total Revenue

Expiring Soon

Each card should show a title, count/value, and icon.

Users Table View (Main Section)

Create a data table listing all users with the following columns:

User Name

Email

Playlist Subscribed

Subscription Due Date

Amount Paid

Invoice (Download button)

Status (Active / Expired)

Add a search bar and filter dropdown (Active / Expired / All).

Add pagination at the bottom (10 users per page).

Playlist Details Modal

When clicking on a user’s playlist name, open a modal showing:

Playlist name

List of videos included

Subscription duration

Progress bar (completion %)

Invoice Download Button

Each row should have a “Download” button styled with Tailwind, showing a download icon.

Clicking it should trigger a sample file download (use dummy file link for now).

Styling & Layout

Use Tailwind CSS for layout and styling (clean, light theme).

Sidebar and header should remain fixed; main content scrollable.

Cards and modals should have shadows, rounded corners, and hover effects.

Data Source

Use a dummy JSON array for now, like:

const users = [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: "John Doe",
    email: "john@example.com",
    playlist: "React for Beginners",
    dueDate: "2025-12-01",
    amountPaid: "₹500",
    invoiceUrl: "#",
    status: "Active"
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: "Jane Smith",
    email: "jane@example.com",
    playlist: "Python Basics",
    dueDate: "2025-11-15",
    amountPaid: "₹750",
    invoiceUrl: "#",
    status: "Expired"
  }
];


Display this mock data in the table.

Component Structure

/components/DashboardCards.jsx

/components/UserTable.jsx

/components/Sidebar.jsx

/components/TopNavbar.jsx

/components/PlaylistModal.jsx

/pages/AdminDashboard.jsx (main page combining all)

Export

Export default AdminDashboard component.

It should render all UI elements together in a responsive layout.

Enhancement (Optional)

Add dark mode toggle using Tailwind’s dark classes.

Add a small chart widget (e.g., total revenue trend using Recharts or Chart.js).

Use icons from Lucide or HeroIcons for better visuals.

💡 Use realistic mock data and visually appealing Tailwind styles to make the dashboard feel production-ready.
