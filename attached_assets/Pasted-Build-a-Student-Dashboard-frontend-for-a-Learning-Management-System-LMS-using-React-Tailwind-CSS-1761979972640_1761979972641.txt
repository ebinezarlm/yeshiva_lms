Build a Student Dashboard frontend for a Learning Management System (LMS) using React + Tailwind CSS.

The dashboard should follow the same design system as the Tutor and Admin dashboards — sidebar navigation, top bar with search/profile, blue-gray & indigo color theme, and responsive Tailwind layout.

🧩 Dashboard Structure
