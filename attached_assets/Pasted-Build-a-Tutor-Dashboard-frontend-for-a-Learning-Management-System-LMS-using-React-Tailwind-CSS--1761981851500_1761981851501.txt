Build a Tutor Dashboard frontend for a Learning Management System (LMS) using React + Tailwind CSS.
The dashboard should match the visual and UX style of the Admin Dashboard (sidebar navigation, top bar, blue-gray theme, responsive design).

🧩 Dashboard Structure

Sidebar navigation should include:

Dashboard (Overview)

My Playlists

Upload Videos

Comments & Questions

Earnings Summary

Profile Settings

📊 1. Dashboard (Overview Page)

Show key tutor metrics using cards:

Total Playlists

Optional: small chart showing earnings or views over time (use dummy data)

Include a greeting message like “Welcome back, [Tutor Name]”

🎞️ 2. My Playlists Page

Display all playlists created by the tutor in a card/grid layout

Each card should show:

Playlist Title

Buttons on each card:

“View Playlist” → opens modal or new page listing videos

Add a top-right “+ Create New Playlist” button that opens a modal form with:
